# Multi Scale Time Series Clustering

> Time-series data is a collection of data points recorded over time, each associated with a specific timestamp. This form of data is prevalent in various fields such as finance, economics, meteorology, healthcare, energy, telecommunications, and transportation. Current algorithms assume that we only have time-series data of the same scaling, but in real-world data time-series often consists of different scalings, e.g. hourly, daily, or weekly weather forecasts. This project will mainly focus on the development of a clustering algorithm that can handle time series with different scalings. 

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for my bachelor thesis on clustering time-series data with different scalings. The project focuses on developing clustering algorithms that are robust to the varying temporal resolutions found in real-world data (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).

## Objectives

- **Develop clustering algorithms:** Create/apply methods that effectively cluster time-series data with different scalings.
- **Evaluate performance:** Test and validate the algorithms on various datasets.
- **(Optional Extension):** Generate graphs from time-series data, apply clustering algorithms to the graphs, and compare the results with the time series clustering using similarity measures.

## Installation/Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
	git clone https://github.com/QuirkyCroissant/Multi-Scale-Time-Series-Clustering
	```
	
	
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
	python -m venv env
	source env/bin/activate   
	```
	
3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

4. **Run the project:**

    Run the application by specifying the mode and additional optional flags:
    
    ```bash
    # For demo (prototype) mode with new synthetic data and various plots:
    python src/main.py --mode demo --new_data --comp_img
    
    # For production mode:
    python src/main.py --mode prod
    ```

    **Available Command-Line Flags:**
    - `--mode`: **Required.** Choose `demo` for synthetic dataset generation, corruption, restoration, and clustering; or `prod` for processing a pre-specified dataset.
    - `--new_data`: **Optional (demo mode only).** Generates new synthetic data (clean and corrupted). Cannot be used with production mode.
    - `--comp_img`: **Optional.** Saves comparison plots of the time series at various pipeline stages (e.g., clean vs. corrupted, and clean vs. interpolated).
